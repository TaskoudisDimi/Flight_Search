## **Flight Search App with Python-Flask**
It is an application that shows flights based on the user's chosen **country code** and **dates**.
It is built with the **Flask framework**, and whenever the user searches for a flight, the application makes API calls to Amadeus to pull the appropriate information.
In order to run the application in Windows, one must execute the following commands:

```pip install -r req.txt```  
```python Flask.py```
